# NextStep USA - Editable HTML Content Management System

## Overview

This solution provides an easy way to edit sections of your long HTML document while keeping it self-contained. Instead of manually searching through 523 lines of HTML, you can now edit content through a user-friendly interface.

## Files Included

1. **`index_editable.html`** - The main editable template
2. **`extract_content.py`** - Python script to extract content from your original HTML
3. **`index.html`** - Your original HTML file (already exists)
4. **`README_EDITABLE_SYSTEM.md`** - This documentation

## How It Works

The system uses a **modular approach** where:

- **Content is separated from structure** - All editable content is stored in JavaScript objects
- **Visual editing interface** - Click "Edit" buttons to modify sections
- **Real-time preview** - See changes immediately
- **Persistent storage** - Changes are saved to browser localStorage
- **Export/Import** - Backup and restore content as JSON files

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Extract Content from Original HTML

Run the Python script to extract content from your original HTML:

```bash
python extract_content.py
```

This will create `extracted_content.json` with content from your original file.

### Step 2: Open the Editable Template

Open `index_editable.html` in your web browser.

### Step 3: Import Content

1. Click the **"Import Content"** button in the top-left corner
2. Select the `extracted_content.json` file
3. Your content will be loaded into the editable sections

### Step 4: Edit Content

1. Click any **"Edit"** button on a section
2. Modify the HTML content in the popup editor
3. Use **"Preview"** to see changes temporarily
4. Click **"Save Changes"** to apply permanently

## Features

### Advanced Editing Features

### Content Management

### Section Types

1. **Header** - Navigation and branding
2. **Hero** - Main headline and primary CTA
3. **Benefits** - Key advantages of EB-2 NIW visa
4. **Process** - Step-by-step application process
5. **Testimonials** - Client reviews and success stories

## Benefits Over Manual Editing

### Before (Manual HTML Editing)
- ❌ Search through 523 lines of HTML
- ❌ Risk breaking the document structure
- ❌ No visual feedback
- ❌ Difficult to track changes
- ❌ Easy to miss sections

### After (Editable System)
- ✅ Visual section identification
- ✅ Isolated editing (can't break other sections)
- ✅ Real-time preview
- ✅ Change tracking and backup
- ✅ Clear section organization

## Technical Details

### Content Storage
Content is stored in a JavaScript object structure:

```javascript
const contentSections = {
    header: {
        title: "Header Section",
        description: "Navigation and branding elements",
        content: "<header>...</header>"
    },
    // ... other sections
};
```

### Persistence
- Changes are automatically saved to `localStorage`
- Content can be exported/imported as JSON files
- No server required - everything works client-side

### Browser Compatibility
- Works in all modern browsers
- No external dependencies
- Self-contained solution

## Workflow Recommendations

### For Content Updates
1. Open `index_editable.html`
2. Import your latest content JSON
3. Edit sections as needed
4. Preview changes
5. Save and export updated content
6. Replace content in your production HTML

### For New Content Creation
1. Use the template sections as starting points
2. Edit each section with your specific content
3. Export the final content
4. Use the exported JSON as your content source

### For Team Collaboration
1. Export content to JSON
2. Share JSON files with team members
3. Each person can edit their assigned sections
4. Merge changes by importing/exporting JSON files

## Troubleshooting

### Content Not Loading
- Check that your JSON file is valid
- Ensure the file path is correct
- Try refreshing the page

### Changes Not Saving
- Check browser localStorage is enabled
- Try exporting content manually
- Clear browser cache if needed

### Editor Not Opening
- Check for JavaScript errors in browser console
- Ensure all files are in the same directory
- Try a different browser

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Styling
You can modify the CSS in `index_editable.html` to match your brand colors and styling.

### Adding New Sections
1. Add a new section to the `contentSections` object
2. Add the corresponding HTML structure
3. Update the section descriptions

### Integration with CMS
The JSON export/import system makes it easy to integrate with content management systems.

## Security Notes

- This system runs entirely in the browser
- No data is sent to external servers
- Content is stored locally in localStorage
- Export/import uses local file system

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify all files are in the correct directory
3. Try the troubleshooting steps above
4. Export your content before making major changes
